  /* An efferent junction is a connection from a neuron to a body part.
   * It can be thought of similarly to a neuromuscular junction (a synapse
   * between efferent nerve fibers and muscle fibres).

   * --------
   * Values:
   * --------

   * bodyPart
   *  The body part this junction targets for manipulation.

   * impulseQueue
   *  The body part this junction targets for manipulation.

   * --------
   * Methods:
   * --------

   * impulse()
   *  Combines the data in the impulse queue and uses
   *  the overall result to inform some manipulation of
   *  the body part.

   * pushImpulse(value)
   *  Pushes the value onto the impulse queue.
   *  Connect this function to a neuron by using the
   *  Neuron.connect(axon_index, dendrite) method and
   *  treating pushImpulse as the dendrite.
   *  Remember to .bind() pushImpulse so that this
   *  refers to the correct junction when it is called.
