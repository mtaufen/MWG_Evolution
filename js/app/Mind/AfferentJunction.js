   * It effectively serves as a sensory receptor.

   * --------
   * Values:
   * --------

   * bodyPart
   *  The body part to get data from.

   * dendrites
   *  The dendrites of the target neuron or neurons to propagate
   *  data to. These dendrites are input to that neuron, not to this
   *  junction.

   * --------
   * Methods:
   * --------

   * sense()
   *  Accesses the datum this junction observes, then returns
   *  that value. You should create a closure around the body
   *  part when you define the sense() function.

   * impulse()
   *  Propagates this junction's datum onto all connected dendrites.

   * synapse(dendrite)
   *  Connects the dendrite to this junction.
